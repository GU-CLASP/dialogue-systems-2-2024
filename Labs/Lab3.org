#+TITLE: Lab 3. Multimodality 
** Getting started: 

1. Register at https://furhat.io/ (“Get SDK”) and install the SDK and virtual Furhat.
2. Launch virtual Furhat and Start Remote API.
3. Clone the repository: https://github.com/vladmaraev/xstate-furhat-starter.
4. If you wish you can use other ways to control Furhat, namely Kotlin Skill API or Blockly.

   
** Tasks:

1. Create at least two new gestures for Furhat of your liking
   (e.g. eye-rolling, eye and head movements).
2. Implement user-tracking for Furhat to attend to the user.
3. Include your gestures as part of a short demonstration dialogue.
4. Create one new gesture for Furhat with audio sound. You can also
   add audio to one of the existing gestures (e.g. anger).
